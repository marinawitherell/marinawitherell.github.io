# My Resume

## Education
**Oregon State University** *Upcoming graduation June 2025*
B.S. Biological Data Sciences, Minors in Statistics and Computer Science
* Provides a background in Biology, Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science

## Work Experience
**Biological Data Scientist** May 2023 - Present
*Oregon State University | Corvallis, OR*
* P.I.: Jeff Chang, Niklaus Grunwald
* This lab worked with bacterial pathogens and devised a pipeline in Nextflow in which scientists will eventually be able to input the genome of any organism (bacteria or eukaryote) and return a report with the sequenced genome, a phylogenetic tree, and what species it is or otherwise closely related to.
* Worked with RScript and Python to create scripts that would perform certain tasks throughout the pipeline, such as analyze the references for the closest matches and determine the needed depth for sequencing.
* Used bash script and Conda to install and run most Nextflow procedures.
* Submitted scripts to be accepted to the NF-Core community.
* Created a diagram to visually and simply represent the pipeline to increase understanding of the process for those that are not familiar with the concepts. This increases accessibility and usability of the pipeline.

**RESEARCH ASSISTANT** January 2023 - August 2023
*Oregon State University | Corvallis, OR*
* P.I.: David Hannaway, Linda Brewer
* Extensive research on various forage species, which included in-depth reading and understanding of primary research documents.
* Narrowed down the relevant information to readable tables for the general public to understand and decide which forage species was right for them to grow in their situation.
* Worked with others on these findings and worked with GIS mapping.

**ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT** June 2022 - December 2022
*Northern Appliance | Anchorage, AK*
* Managed the scheduling and billing for clients, while also communicating the policy and answering questions, diffusing any negative situations that occurred.


## Presentations 
* Summary of Pathogen Surveillance Pipeline Using Population Genomics and Sequencing (2023)
